# Notching and Adjustment of Loss Given Default (LGD)

## What is Notching?
**Notching** refers to the practice used by credit rating agencies to adjust the rating of a specific security (e.g., a bond) **up or down by several notches** relative to the issuer's credit rating.  
This adjustment reflects differences in the security’s default risk or loss severity in the event of default.

## Applications of Notching

### 1. Structured Debt and Different Debt Seniorities
- Bonds may be issued in **senior**, **subordinated**, and **junior** tranches.
- Even if issued by the same entity, recovery rates differ in default scenarios, leading to different notching adjustments.

### 2. Secured vs. Unsecured Debt
- **Secured debt** typically has a lower LGD in default and may be rated **one to two notches higher** than the issuer’s rating.
- **Unsecured subordinated debt** typically has a higher LGD and may be rated **several notches lower**.

## How Credit Rating Agencies Adjust LGD Through Notching

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1️⃣ Issuer Credit Rating (ICR) | Assess the overall creditworthiness of the company. |
| 2️⃣ Identify Debt Type | Classify each instrument by its structure and payment priority. |
| 3️⃣ Estimate LGD | Evaluate historical recovery rates, market data, and collateral arrangements. |
| 4️⃣ Apply Notching | Adjust ratings to reflect LGD differences: <br> - Senior Secured: ICR + 1 notch <br> - Subordinated: ICR - 2 notches |

## Example

Assume a company’s ICR is **BBB**:

| Debt Type         | Collateral | Seniority | Rating Adjustment | Final Credit Rating |
|-------------------|------------|-----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Senior Secured    | Secured    | High      | +1 notch          | **BBB+**            |
| Senior Unsecured  | Unsecured  | Medium    | None              | **BBB**             |
| Subordinated      | Unsecured  | Low       | -2 notches        | **BB**              |

## Summary
- **Notching** is a tool for fine-tuning credit risk assessments at the instrument level.
- Its primary purpose is to **reflect LGD differences between debt instruments**.
